!!!! I couldn't make a pull request, but now I can thank to this command:
git pull --no-ff

ls -a // to see all the files and directories

^^^ AWESOME COMMAND
heeey
Testing echo command
Seems like a cool command
echo <sentence> >> <file name>

I'll try to use:
git commit -am "comment"
this allows you to skip the "add" stage, the staging

removed a directory with:
rm -r <dir name>
rm <file name>

git ls-files --- to see all the staged files

Clean compact status
git status -s

Might be useful for checking what changes were made
git diff --staged

See the commits
git log --oneline (--reverse)

HEAD~<num> - it specifies how many steps you wanna go back, ex: 1 = last commit
git show HEAD~1
OR OR OR
You don't have to type the entire ID, as long as there is no other id that starts with let's say first 4 characters
git show <commit ID> (ex: c4859ff)
